# Duration-and-Expectation-Analysis-by-Pranjal-kashyap

Overview
This project provides tools and guidelines for performing duration and expectation analysis using Microsoft Excel. The repository includes sample data, 
Excel templates, and detailed instructions to help you analyze and visualize time-based metrics effectively.

Introduction
This repository is designed to assist users in conducting duration and expectation analysis using Excel. Whether you’re analyzing project timelines,
task durations, or any other time-based data, this guide will walk you through the process from data collection to reporting.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Microsoft Excel (2016 or later recommended)
Basic knowledge of Excel functions and features
Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/duration-expectation-analysis-excel.git

Data Analysis
Descriptive Analysis
Use Excel functions like AVERAGE, SUM, COUNT, etc., to get a basic understanding of your data.

Visual Analysis
Create charts and graphs (e.g., Gantt charts, line graphs, bar charts) to visualize your data. Use the Insert tab to add these elements.

Expectation Analysis
Compare actual durations against expected durations to identify discrepancies. Use conditional formatting to highlight tasks
that exceed or fall short of expectations.

Example
Here’s a simple example to illustrate:

Task	Start Date	End Date	Expected Duration (days)	Actual Duration (days)
Task 1	01/01/2024	05/01/2024	4	4
Task 2	02/01/2024	06/01/2024	3	4
Task 3	03/01/2024	07/01/2024	5	4
Task 4	04/01/2024	08/01/2024	4	4
Descriptive Analysis: Calculate the average actual duration using =AVERAGE(E2:E5).

Reporting
Summarize your findings in a separate sheet or a report. Use text boxes to add explanations and insights. Ensure your report is clear and easy to understand. 
Use headings, bullet points, and other formatting tools to organize your information.
